											The film opens as the sun rises over the woods. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth) are stalking a flock of turkeys. Katniss draws an arrow and fires, but when she strikes her target, she sees Marvel (Jack Quaid), the tribute she killed a year earlier after he killed her friend Rue (Amandla Stenberg). She begins to freak out and panic before Gale walks her away from there.
											Katniss is set to go on a victory tour around Panem to each district. Gale is still unhappy with watching her and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) display their supposed love during the previous Hunger Games, though Katniss insists that she had to do it. Before Gale leaves, he kisses Katniss.
											She enters the Victors Village where she now lives with her mother (Paula Malcomson) and sister Prim (Willow Shields). She makes a quick stop at the home of Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), who is face down drunk on his table. Katniss throws some cold water on him to wake him up before Peeta enters with some bread. She reminds them to get ready as the cameras are arriving soon. When she gets to her home, she finds President Snow (Donald Sutherland) waiting for her. He has a projector that shows the footage of the previous Games that ended with Katniss and Peeta nearly committing a double suicide by ingesting the poison nightshade berries. Snow claims that this act of defiance against the Capitol is likely to inspire a rebellion amongst everybody else in the other districts. Additionally, he wants her to continue showcasing her publicized romance with Peeta before he leaves, he makes his threat clear by showing Katniss footage of Gale kissing her.
											Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), dressed in one of her usual bright and gaudy outfits, arrives to the Victors Village with her assistants Flavius (Nelson Ascencio) and Octavia (Bruce Bundy), along with Katniss's stylist Cinna (Lenny Kravitz). They all prep her and Peeta up as the cameras arrive outside for them to be presented on Caesar Flickerman's (Stanley Tucci) show. Katniss and Peeta walk out of their homes to hug, but they slip on the ice and fall on each other. Katniss kisses Peeta for the cameras, though Peeta knows that's exactly what it was - just a display.
											Katniss, Peeta, Haymitch, Effie, and Cinna all ride the train to start their tour. Katniss considers her victory hollow when remembering that she had to kill other innocent people to survive. She walks to another cart where Peeta follows. He still at least wants to maintain a friendship with her, despite his broken heart. While they ride through the tunnels, they notice the symbol of a mockingjay spray-painted on the walls. They also spot vans full of the Capitol's Peacekeepers arriving.
											On their first stop in District 11, Effie gives Katniss and Peeta cards with speeches for them to read aloud. Peeta offers to do the talking when Katniss becomes uneasy. They are there to commemorate Rue and Thresh (Dayo Okeniyi) before the families of the two of them. Peeta begins his speech, but then goes off-script to offer a portion of his and Katniss's earnings to the families each month for the rest of their lives. Haymitch watches and responds Oh, shit. The two of them almost leave, but Katniss steps forward to speak. She expresses her gratitude for Thresh sparing her life when he had the chance to kill her, and then tearfully honors Rue as her friend. One man in the crowd gives Katniss the three-finger salute and whistles the iconic three-note tune. Everybody else in the crowd joins him. This catches the attention of the Peacekeepers, who grab the man from the crowd and carry him to the stage as Katniss and Peeta are taken away. Katniss tries to stop them from hurting the man, but she only manages to catch a glimpse of a Peacekeeper shooting the man in the back of the head. A distraught Katniss feels responsible for this and confides to Peeta and Haymitch that Snow threatened her family. Haymitch tells them that they are now targets and to just stick to their written speeches to avoid trouble.
											The duo continue their tour across Panem. A similar incident occurs with another man in one district, but Katniss is forced to continue her speech. Another crowd begins to riot in another district. One girl even tells Katniss that she plans to volunteer when she is old enough, making Katniss terribly uncomfortable. She even wakes up screaming at night from a nightmare. Peeta goes to her room and stays with her to comfort her. Snow, meanwhile, watches everything unfold with his granddaughter, who has braided her hair similar to Katniss.
											Realizing that they need to placate the possible rebellion and settle any dispute between Katniss and Snow, she and Peeta do a public proposal which is broadcast on Caesar's show. Gale watches while working in the mines, clearly upset. Effie takes Katniss and Peeta to a party at the Capitol where Snow is set to congratulate the two. There, Katniss meets Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the new head Gamemaker to replace Seneca Crane after Snow had him killed.
											Katniss returns to District 12 to find Gale. She suggests that he joins her and her family to run away into the woods where nobody can find them. In the town square, the Peacekeepers, led by Commander Thread (Patrick St. Esprit), arrive to terrorize the people. Katniss rescues a woman who was struck in the eye, while Gale tackles Thread before he can beat on a defenseless woman. While Katniss tends to the woman she saved, she hears the sound of a whip cracking and Gale yelling in pain. He's been tied to a post set up in the square while Thread whips him in front of everybody. Katniss runs to stop him but Thread punches her in the face. She gets on her feet to defend Gale, and Thread pulls a gun on her. Haymitch rushes over to intervene (followed by Peeta), reminding Thread that he just threatened the darling of the Capitol, and he just marked her face on the eve of her wedding. Thread relents but vows to kill her, Gale, and Haymitch next time this happens. He barks at the other citizens that their curfew is in effect, and anybody seen after dark will be shot.
											Katniss, Haymitch, and Peeta take Gale to her home to tend to his wounds. Prim and her mother gather snow to treat him. Peeta offers to watch Gale while Katniss goes to get more snow. Prim gathers some with her and tells her that since the last Games, she has noticed a rise in hope among everybody else. Katniss hugs her sister and tells her she loves her. Prim does the same.
											Snow and Plutarch watch the footage of this event from their projector back in the Capitol. Snow continues to view Katniss as a threat and wants her eliminated soon. Plutarch agrees, but says it ought to be under the proper circumstances.
											The following day, Snow makes the announcement for the 75th Hunger Games, aka the Quarter Quell. He states that the male and female victors from each district will be selected to compete. Katniss watches in her home, and her mother starts to weep. Haymitch throws a bottle at the screen in anger. Katniss runs into the woods for a while to cry. When she comes back, she sees Haymitch. He promises to go through with the Games if his name is called, but he can't do anything if Peeta volunteers for him.
											Effie is onstage before everyone in District 12 to announce this year's tributes. Since Katniss is the only female victor from that district, her name is the only one pulled out. She sheds a tear, and even Effie looks devastated to have had to call her name. Next, Effie calls Haymitch's name for the male tribute, but Peeta immediately volunteers in his place. Katniss is pulled away before she can properly say goodbye to Prim.
											As they make their way to the Capitol to begin preparations for the Quarter Quell, Haymitch reminds Katniss and Peeta that the victors they will face are pure stone cold killers, some of which are already allies. He briefs them on a handful of the victors - from District 1 are brother-and-sister duo Cashmere (Stephanie Leigh Schlund) and Gloss (Alan Ritchson). District 2 has the fierce and vicious Brutus (Bruno Gunn) and Enobaria (Meta Golding), the latter having filed her teeth into fangs so she can easily rip out peoples' throats. From District 3 are Beetee (Jeffrey Wright) and Wiress (Amanda Plummer). What they lack in strength, they make up for in smarts. District 6 has male and female Morphlings, so named for their the effects caused to them by a painkiller drug. The other darling of the Capitol is District 4's Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin; cue theater full of fangirls swooning), a cocky and clever victor who was the youngest to win at the age of 14. Joining him is Mags (Lynn Cohen), volunteering in place of a girl named Annie Cresta (Stef Dawson).
											Before they go into the Capitol, Finnick meets Katniss for the first time, offering her a sugar cube before making smug comments regarding her romance with Peeta. He joins Katniss on their chariot as they ride into the stadium before the cheering audience. Using a device Cinna gave her, Katniss activates the simulated flames on hers and Peeta's clothes, giving everybody that Girl on Fire flair that the Capitol fiercely craves. After that, the duo and Haymitch meet District 7's Johanna Mason (Jena Malone). She has Peeta unzip her outfit, and she goes completely nude. Peeta and Haymitch grin while Katniss is annoyed.
											The Tributes start their training. Gloss is quick with his weapons, as is Johanna with her axe. Katniss meets Beetee and Wiress as they try to start a fire. Beetee observes Plutarch and the other Gamemakers in their station and notices that there is a slightly visible force field surrounding them. Katniss then walks over to Mags, who never speaks a word. They recognize the bravery in each other for volunteering in place of someone else. Katniss then proceeds to work out her archery skills with her bow and arrow. When meeting with Peeta and Haymitch later, she decides that she wants to ally herself with Beetee and Wiress, and possibly Mags (Peeta doesn't quite like that).
											Each Tribute is called in for personal assessment. When Katniss is called in, she finds a drawing on the floor of a dead Rue, holding flowers. The image horrifies Katniss, and in response, she takes a mannequin, and hangs it by the neck before the Gamemakers. It's shown that she wrote Seneca Crane on the mannequin.
											Caesar interviews the Tributes on his show before the eager audience. Cashmere puts on the waterworks to gain sympathy (Effie, Flavius, and Octavia buy it). Finnick gives a shout out to his beloved Annie, saying that if he should die, his last thoughts will be of her lips. Johanna gives a very vocal fuck you (albeit a censored one) to the Capitol for bringing her back to die again after she hoped to live the rest of her life in peace. When Katniss is up, she puts on a wedding dress made by Cinna. Onstage, she spins around to produce the flames, which reveal a black dress underneath, and when Katniss spreads her arms, a pair of wings emerge to represent the mockingjay. The audience is thrilled, but Snow is clearly not. Peeta goes up next and lies by saying that he and Katniss married in secret, adding that they are having a baby. The audience is now shocked and begins to boo out of concern for the beloved couple. The show ends with the Tributes holding hands.
											Haymitch commends Peeta for the baby story, though it's not enough to get the Games cancelled. Effie comes in with a gold wristband for Haymitch and a gold medallion for Peeta, both as gifts to represent their little team (Effie has gold hair while Katniss has her mockingjay pin). After she and Peeta leave, Katniss reminds Haymitch to keep his promise to protect Peeta. He does and in return reminds Katniss to remember who the real enemy is.
											On the day of the Games, Cinna escorts Katniss to the arena. A tracker is injected into her arm as it was the previous year. Before she gets onto the platform, Cinna says he's still betting on her. As Katniss steps onto the platform, a trio of Peacekeepers enter and begin to brutally beat Cinna with their batons. Katniss yells at them to stop but they drag Cinna's body out.
											The platform brings Katniss to the surface of the arena over a saltwater lake. She searches for Peeta but cannot find him. The Games commence, and she jumps into the lake to swim to the Cornucopia to grab her weapons. Finnick protects her after revealing that Haymitch gave him the gold wristband to mark his alliance with Katniss. They find a Tribute attacking Peeta in the lake. They both sink, and the boom of a cannon (marking someone's death) is heard. Katniss is fearful when she sees a corpse float up, but Peeta emerges alive and well. Together with Finnick carrying Mags on his back, they all escape into the jungle with their weapons handy.
											Peeta cuts through the vines and branches to clear the path as they search for fresh water. Katniss notices something suspicious, but before she can warn Peeta, he swings his machete onto the force field, which causes a powerful spark that throws him back. He isn't breathing. Finnick performs CPR on him until Peeta is revived. Katniss kisses him in relief and helps him back on his feet. Katniss climbs a tree and shoots an arrow into the sky, which hits the force field. She realizes they are in a dome, and then gets a better look at the wheel in the center where they all emerged.
											As it gets dark, a container floats down on a parachute. It contains a small metal pipe (or rather, a spile) from Haymitch that the four Tributes use to stick in a tree and drink fresh water. The music plays as the screen on the dome lights up to announce the first eight Tributes to have been killed that day. From a distance, the four notice a tree being continuously struck by lightning. Katniss counts 12 strikes, one for each district.
											While the other three sleep, Katniss notices a fog rolling in. She sticks her hand out and is severely burned. She wakes the others up to tell them the fog is poisonous. They all make a run for it. Peeta is terribly burnt by the fog, causing grotesque boils to swell on his skin. He is weakened and unable to go further. Katniss is unable to carry him, so Mags decides to make the sacrifice. She kisses Finnick and walks into the fog to die. He and Katniss carry Peeta further until they stumble far from the fog, which is held back by the force field. They find a lake which mends the boils on their skin. Not long after, a group of vicious baboons comes upon the trio. Using their weapons, they fight them off one by one. The female Morphling emerges from the tree to stop one baboon from attacking Peeta, getting her throat bitten in the process. Peeta pulls her away from them, running with Katniss and Finnick toward the beach until the baboons stop following them. Peeta allows the Morphling to watch the sunrise before she dies. He lets her body float in the water as a hovercraft lowers a crane to pull her body up. Suddenly, the trio hears a scream, just as a large tsunami crashes down on the forest. It's too far to reach them though, yet the cannon booms to signal that person's death.
											Not far from them, the trio notice Johanna, Beetee, and Wiress emerging from the jungle, all of them covered in blood. Johanna explains that it began to rain blood in their area. Wiress, due to shock and dehydration, continues to only say Tick tock. Johanna gets annoyed with her, but Katniss defends Wiress, nearly getting into a scuffle with Johanna. Johanna tells her to calm down as she protected Beetee and Wiress for Katniss.
											Lightning strikes the tree again. Katniss realizes that Wiress saying tick tock means that she figured that the arena represents a clock. A new threat emerges every hour. First the fog, then the baboons, followed by something the next hour. The group walks toward the Cornucopia to devise a plan, when Gloss arrives and stabs Wiress in the back. Katniss kills him with an arrow. Cashmere attempts to strike, but Johanna kills her with her axe. Plutarch, watching with the other Gamemakers, causes the arena to rotate in a clockwise motion. The effect throws Katniss into the lake, but once the rotation stops, she climbs back onto the rocks and runs away with the remaining group.
											Upon re-entering the jungle, Katniss hears what sounds like Prim screaming to her for help. She runs into the jungle and hits a bird, which is what is making the sound. Finnick then hears Annie crying for help. The birds are jabberjays, which copy sounds and voices from others. Finnick worries because they had to have copied someone. A whole flock flies around Katniss, frightening her with Prim's voice, and then Gale's, all while Peeta tries to calm her. When they are gone, she regains composure. Peeta and Johanna remind her that there is no way Prim, Annie, or Gale could be in trouble, since this would be cause enough to incite more trouble. Johanna shouts to the sky hoping to rile up Snow further.
											The group gathers around as Beetee devises a plan. Using a wire he had been gathering with a coil, he suggests tying the wire to the tree where the lightning will strike and running it into the ocean, so that at the right hour when the next wave hits, it will conduct an electrical current to everything in its path, which would also get rid of Brutus, Enobaria, and any other Tribute that poses a threat.
											On the beach, Katniss and Peeta share a moment to themselves. Peeta admits that he and Haymitch also made promises to each other to protect Katniss. He gives her a locket with pictures of Prim, Gale, and her mother to remind her that she has people who are counting on her, while Peeta has nobody. If Katniss dies and he lives, he has nothing. She gives him a genuine kiss this time.
											The group gets ready to set Beetee's plan in motion. The screen lights up to display the recently deceased Tributes. Peeta and Finnick stay to look out for Beetee while Katniss and Johanna take the wire themselves. Katniss notices the wire gets stuck on a rock until it snaps. From the shadows emerge Brutus and Enobaria. Johanna knocks Katniss down and cuts into her arm. She whispers for her to stay down and runs from the District 2 Tributes as they chase her. Katniss then hears Finnick's voice calling for Johanna. She remains hidden and runs back to the tree. There, she finds Beetee has been wounded by the force field. Peeta is nowhere to be found. Katniss hears someone coming. She pulls an arrow out and aims it with her bow. Finnick comes out, and Snow watches with anticipation. Finnick echoes Haymitch's earlier statement - Remember who the real enemy is. Katniss then sees the clouds forming from above as the lightning is set to strike. She ties some wire around the arrow, aims it high, and shoots it just as the lightning comes down. It strikes the arrow, causing a great explosion that throws her and Finnick backwards. The force field is destroyed and the dome begins to collapse all around Katniss as she lays and watches the light shine down on her. A hovercraft flies down and lowers the crane to pull her up.
											Katniss wakes up with an oxygen mask on her. Next to her is Beetee, barely conscious but alive. She finds a syringe and grabs it, then walks further. She hears Haymitch's voice saying She will lose her mind if she finds out about the boy. Then she hears Plutarch's voice. She opens the door to find the two men, along with Finnick. It turns out that Plutarch was working with Haymitch the whole time against the Capitol. The plan was to get her out once the Quell was announced, and several Tributes were in on it. They are currently on their way to District 13, which was previously thought to have been completely destroyed. Finnick adds that Johanna had cut the tracker out of Katniss's arm. Katniss asks for Peeta, and Haymitch says that he was taken by the Capitol along with Johanna. A furious Katniss slaps Haymitch, feeling betrayed for Peeta not being protected. Plutarch then sedates her.
											Gale sits by Katniss's bedside as she wakes up. He tells her she's been out for days. She asks about her mother and Prim. Gale says he got them out before it was too late. Apparently, some Peacekeeper hovercrafts came down and began firebombing. Katniss is confused and asks about the district. Gale responds, Katniss, there is no District 12. It's all gone.
											The film ends with a shot of Katniss's face, filled with grief and despair before slowly turning into a look of rage. She now knows who the real enemy is.
